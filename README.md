# Magiedit-VSCode

## Features

### Publish

Publish your markdown content directly from inside VSCode

## Requirements

The only requirement is creating an account on [magiedit](https://magiedit.magitools.app) (or any other instance of magiedit xD) and generating an API Key

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `magiedit-vscode.url`: The url of the magiedit instance you want to interact with
* `magiedit-vscode.api_key`: The API key you generated in your selected magiedit instance

## Known Issues

For now, there is really no proper error handling. It'll come soon, I promise!
